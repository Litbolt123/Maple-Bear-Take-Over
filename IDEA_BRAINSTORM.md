## 📝 Notes

- All ideas should fit the existing lore about white powder, bears, infection, and the mysterious nature of the outbreak
- Consider the day progression system (Days 2, 4, 8, 13, 20, 25+)
- Maintain the atmospheric tone: mysterious, unsettling, with hints of something greater controlling events
- The "counting" and "memory" themes from late lore should be incorporated where possible
- Ideas should enhance the survival horror/apocalypse feel
