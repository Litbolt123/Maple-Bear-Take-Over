## Intro: per-player so each new player gets full intro

Previously the intro was tracked with a **world** property (`mb_world_intro_seen`), so once any player had seen the intro in that world, no other player ever got it. Requirement: **each player who has not joined a world before should get the full intro.**

### Changes made

1. **main.js**
   - Added **PLAYER_INTRO_SEEN_PROPERTY** (`mb_intro_seen`) — per-player dynamic property meaning "this player has seen the intro."
   - **showWorldIntroSequence**: checks/sets **getPlayerProperty(player, PLAYER_INTRO_SEEN_PROPERTY)** instead of world property, so only that player is marked as having seen the intro.
   - **Player join handler**: uses **getPlayerProperty(player, PLAYER_INTRO_SEEN_PROPERTY)** to decide whether to show intro for this player.
   - **Discovery suppression**, **spawn fallback**, **minor infection init**, **giveBasicJournalIfNeeded**: all now use the **player’s** intro-seen flag (getPlayerProperty(player, PLAYER_INTRO_SEEN_PROPERTY)) so behavior is per-player.
   - Left WORLD_INTRO_SEEN_PROPERTY in place as legacy; intro logic no longer uses it.

2. **mb_dayTracker.js**
   - Import **getPlayerProperty** from `mb_dynamicPropertyHandler.js`.
   - "First-time player" and welcome-message timing now use **getPlayerProperty(player, "mb_intro_seen")** so each player is classified by whether **they** have seen the intro.

Result: Every player who joins and has not seen the intro before gets the full intro sequence; returning players skip it. State is stored per player (dynamic property), not per world.

## Mining AI: cleanup lastBlockBreakTick to prevent unbounded memory growth (mb_miningAI.js)

The per-entity Map **lastBlockBreakTick** (lines 267–269) was never cleared; only **lastMiningTick** was pruned in the existing cleanup routine. Inactive entity IDs could accumulate in **lastBlockBreakTick** and cause memory growth.

### Fix

- In the same cleanup block that prunes **lastMiningTick** (around line 10676), added a matching loop for **lastBlockBreakTick**: iterate over `lastBlockBreakTick.entries()`, and for each `entityId` where `!activeWorkerIds.has(entityId)`, call `lastBlockBreakTick.delete(entityId)`.
- **buildQueues** is already cleaned in this routine via the existing loop that calls `releasePlan(entityId)` for inactive entities (lines 10655–10660), so no change was needed there.

Result: **lastBlockBreakTick** and **lastMiningTick** stay in sync; both maps are pruned for the same inactive entity IDs, preventing unbounded growth.

## Mining AI: run every tick for movement, throttle only block breaking (mb_miningAI.js)

Bears were going slow and not climbing blocks/stairs because **processContext** was only called every **miningInterval** ticks (2–12 ticks by day) for leaders and followers. That throttled the whole AI (pathfinding, steering, climbing) instead of only block-breaking speed.

### Fix

1. **Main loop**  
   Leaders and followers now run **processContext every tick**. The `if (ticksSinceLastMining >= miningInterval)` guard and `lastMiningTick.set` for leaders/followers were removed so movement and climbing run every tick.

2. **Block-breaking throttle inside processContext**  
   - New map: **lastBlockBreakTick** — last tick this entity broke a block.  
   - At start of processContext: `miningInterval = getMiningInterval()`, `allowMiningThisTick = (tick - lastBlockBreakTick) >= miningInterval`, `effectiveBudget = allowMiningThisTick ? digBudget : 0`, and **digContext.max = effectiveBudget**.  
   - At end of processContext: if `digContext.cleared > 0` then `lastBlockBreakTick.set(entity.id, tick)`.

Result: Bears get steering/impulse and stair logic every tick (responsive movement and climbing). Block breaking still respects mining speed (every 2–12 ticks by day). Idle bears unchanged (still process at miningInterval * 2).

---

## Mining debug logging reverted (mb_miningAI.js)

Rate-limited mining debug (DEBUG_LOG_INTERVAL / shouldLogMiningDebug) was reverted because mining bears stopped jumping onto 1-block steps and climbing upward stairs. All rate-limiting was removed and the original pattern restored (see above for the actual movement fix).

## Snow block lists extracted to shared module

`SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS` and `SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS` were duplicated in `BP/scripts/mb_torpedoAI.js` (lines 28–46) and `BP/scripts/main.js`. They were moved into a shared module and both files now import them.

### Changes made

1. **New `BP/scripts/mb_blockLists.js`**  
   - Exports `SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS` and `SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS` (same names).  
   - Contains the canonical Sets used for death/torpedo snow placement (grass, flowers, foliage; 2-block-tall plants).  
   - `SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS` includes `minecraft:grass_block` (from torpedo list).

2. **`BP/scripts/mb_torpedoAI.js`**  
   - Removed inline `SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS` and `SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS` definitions.  
   - Added: `import { SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS, SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS } from "./mb_blockLists.js";`  
   - All existing usages (e.g. `.has(blockType)`) unchanged; symbols now come from the import.

3. **`BP/scripts/main.js`**  
   - Removed inline `SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS` and `SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS` definitions.  
   - Added: `import { SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS, SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS } from "./mb_blockLists.js";`  
   - All references in death/snow placement logic unchanged; symbols now come from the import.

Result: Single source of truth for snow-replaceable and two-block-plant lists; no code changes needed at call sites beyond the new imports.

## "Check your journal" — one-time only (fixed)

The "Check your journal" message was repeating (once per "batch" until the player opened the journal). It should behave like other discovery messages: **show once ever when the player discovers something new**, and **never repeat** for that same discovery.

### Changes made

1. **Persistent flag in codex** (`mb_codex.js`)  
   - Added `checkJournalMessageShown: false` to `codex.items` in `getDefaultCodex()` so the one-time state is saved with the player's codex.

2. **`main.js`**  
   - Removed the in-memory `checkJournalPendingByPlayer` Map and all references (including the delete when opening the journal).  
   - **`sendDiscoveryMessage`**: When the player has the journal (`snowBookCrafted`), the message and sound are shown only if `!codex.items.checkJournalMessageShown`. When shown, set `codex.items.checkJournalMessageShown = true`, call `markCodex` and `saveCodex`.  
   - **Golden apple infection reduction**: Same logic — show "Check your journal" only if the flag is false; when shown, set the flag and rely on the existing `saveCodex` to persist.

Result: "Check your journal" is sent **once per player** (first discovery with journal); it never repeats, consistent with other discovery messages.

## Addon difficulty (Easy / Normal / Hard)

Per-world difficulty toggle that affects spawn rate, hits to infect, and infection speed. Only first joiner or players with **mb_cheats** can change it; others can see the current value in Settings.

### Changes made

1. **mb_dynamicPropertyHandler.js**
   - **ADDON_DIFFICULTY_PROPERTY** (`mb_addonDifficulty`): world property, values -1 (Easy), 0 (Normal), 1 (Hard).
   - **getAddonDifficultyState()**: returns `{ value, spawnMultiplier, hitsBase, infectionDecayMultiplier, miningIntervalMultiplier, torpedoMaxBlocksMultiplier }` (Easy: 0.7, 4, 0.8, 1.2, 0.85; Normal: 1.0, 3, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0; Hard: 1.3, 2, 1.2, 0.6, 1.5).

2. **mb_spawnController.js**
   - Import **getAddonDifficultyState** from `mb_dynamicPropertyHandler.js`.
   - Spawn chance multiplier is multiplied by **getAddonDifficultyState().spawnMultiplier** (on top of existing Spawn Difficulty).

3. **main.js**
   - Import **getAddonDifficultyState** from `mb_dynamicPropertyHandler.js`.
   - **Hits to infect**: `hitsNeeded` is now **addonDifficulty.hitsBase** (default/immune) or **addonDifficulty.hitsBase - 1** (minor infected), instead of fixed HITS_TO_INFECT / MINOR_HITS_TO_INFECT.
   - **Infection speed**: infection timer decrement (40-tick step) and snow-tier daily decay are multiplied by **getAddonDifficultyState().infectionDecayMultiplier**.
   - Cure messages (minor and major) now show dynamic hit counts from addon difficulty.

4. **mb_codex.js**
   - Import **ADDON_DIFFICULTY_PROPERTY**, **getAddonDifficultyState** from `mb_dynamicPropertyHandler.js`.
   - **openGeneralSettings**: added **Addon Difficulty** dropdown (Easy / Normal / Hard). Read from world property; on save (only if **canChangeBeta(player)**), set **mb_addonDifficulty** and sync **mb_spawnDifficulty** to the same value so spawn matches until overridden in Developer Tools.

5. **docs/CODEX_UNLOCKS.md**
   - New **§11. Addon difficulty**: describes what it affects, where to set it (Journal → Settings → General), who can change it, and that Spawn Difficulty in Developer Tools is separate and can override spawn.

Result: Players set Easy/Normal/Hard in Basic or Powdery Journal → Settings → General; it affects spawn rate, hits to infect, and infection speed for the whole world. Spawn Difficulty (dev-only -5 to +5) remains separate and can be fine-tuned after changing addon difficulty.

## Addon difficulty: UI label, hit messages, mining & torpedo (Hard)

- **Settings label** (mb_codex.js): Normal players see only "Addon Difficulty". Players with **mb_cheats** see the full description with numeric multipliers (spawn, major hits from nothing/minor, infection decay, mining interval, torpedo max blocks) and E/N/H values.
- **Difficulty hit messages**: All player-facing hit counts (summary, infection screen, cure text, item descriptions, progression) now use **getAddonDifficultyState()** instead of hardcoded 2/3.
- **Hard mode** (mb_dynamicPropertyHandler.js): `miningIntervalMultiplier` 0.6 → **0.5**, `torpedoMaxBlocksMultiplier` 1.5 → **2.0**. CODEX_UNLOCKS.md §11 updated to mention mining bear mine speed and torpedo max blocks per dive.

## Developer Tools: Infection button fix and new optional tools

### Bug fix: Infection button (Dusted Journal)

- **Problem**: Clicking "Infection" in the Dusted Journal after using "Fully Unlock Codex" closed the book.
- **Causes**: (1) `isMinor` was only defined inside `if (hasInfection)` but used later when the player had no infection → ReferenceError. (2) `fullyUnlockCodex` set `codex.infections.minor = true` and `codex.infections.major = true` (booleans), while the rest of the code expects `codex.infections.minor.discovered` / `codex.infections.major.discovered` (objects).
- **Fixes**: Define `isMinor` at the start of `openInfections()`; in `fullyUnlockCodex` set `codex.infections.minor = { discovered: true }` and `codex.infections.major = { discovered: true }`; use `minorDiscovered` / `majorDiscovered` helpers that support both object and boolean shapes for existing saves.

### New optional Developer Tools (Codex → Developer Tools)

After existing options (e.g. Spawn Difficulty, Fully Unlock Codex):

1. **Clear / Set Infection** — Menu: Clear infection | Set minor | Set major (`clear_infection`, `set_infection [minor|major]`).
2. **Grant / Remove Immunity** — Grant permanent | Grant temporary (5 min) | Remove immunity (`grant_immunity`, `remove_immunity`).
3. **Reset Intro** — Clears `mb_intro_seen` so the intro plays again on next join (`reset_intro`).
4. **List Nearby Bears** — Prints bear-type counts within 128 blocks in chat (`list_bears`).
5. **Force Spawn** — Choose bear type → target (Near me | other players) → distance (Near 2 blocks | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | Random within 20). Spawns at a random angle at that distance (`force_spawn [entityId] [playerName?] [distance|random]`).
6. **Dump Codex State** — Sends truncated codex JSON to chat (`dump_codex`).
7. **Set Kill Counts** — Select mob type, then 0–500 slider for that mob’s kill count (`set_kill_count [mobKey] [value]`).

**main.js**: New `executeMbCommand` cases for the above. Force spawn supports 2 args (entityId, distance) or 3 (entityId, playerName, distance); distance can be numeric or `"random"` (1–20 blocks).

## Nausea when standing on infected ground too long

Player requested a "little extra push" when standing on infected blocks: add **nausea for 5 seconds** at the same times the existing message (and/or sound) already fire.

### Changes made (main.js)

1. **Constant**  
   - **GROUND_NAUSIA_DURATION_TICKS** = 100 (5 seconds), placed with other ground-exposure constants.

2. **applyEffect(player, "minecraft:nausea", GROUND_NAUSIA_DURATION_TICKS, { amplifier: 0 })** added at every infected-ground warning:
   - **Minor ground warning** (10s): after "§eThe ground beneath you feels wrong...".
   - **Ground warning** (60s): after "§eYou start to feel off...".
   - **Ambient warning** (10 min): after "§eYou start to feel off...".
   - **Major snow increase from ground** (in `applySnowExposureIncrease` when `fromGround`): after the existing subtle `mob.enderman.portal` sound.

Result: Whenever the player gets a message or sound from standing on infected ground (dusted dirt / snow layer), they also get 5 seconds of nausea. Duration is controlled by one constant for easy tuning.

## Achievements, journal UI order, and new/updated section tracking

### 1. Achievements (main.js + mb_codex.js)

- **First Minor Cure**: On first minor cure, set `codex.achievements.firstMinorCure = true`, show action bar "§7First cure. Well done."
- **First Major Cure**: On first major cure, set `codex.achievements.firstMajorCure = true`, show action bar "§7Major infection cured. You did it."
- **First bear kill (per base type)**: In `trackBearKill`, when a base type’s kill count becomes 1, set `codex.achievements.firstKill_<type> = true` and send chat message "§7Achievement: First &lt;label&gt; kill." Base types: Maple Bear (tinyBear), Infected Bear, Buff Maple Bear, Flying Maple Bear, Mining Maple Bear, Torpedo Maple Bear.
- **Achievements section**: Always visible in the Powdery Journal main menu (no longer gated on having any achievement). **openAchievements** now shows First Minor Cure, First Major Cure, and all six first-kill achievements (✓/✗).

### 2. Powdery Journal main menu (mb_codex.js)

- **Order**: Infection → Symptoms → Mobs → Items → Biomes and Blocks → Late Lore → Timeline → Achievements → (Debug Menu, Developer Tools if mb_cheats) → Settings → Search (if enabled).
- **Colors**: §f for content sections, §e for Settings, §b for Search and Debug, §c for Developer Tools. Achievements always shown with §f.
- Search remains toggleable in Settings ("Show Search Button"); Settings and Search at bottom.

### 3. New/updated section tracking (mb_codex.js + mb_dayTracker.js)

- **Default codex**: `journal.sectionLastUnlock`, `journal.sectionLastViewed`, `journal.hasOpenedBefore` added.
- **markCodex**: Maps path prefix (infections/cures/status → infection; effects/snowEffects/symptomsUnlocks/minorInfectionEffects → symptoms; mobs, items, biomes, journal → lateLore) and sets `sectionLastUnlock[section] = Date.now()`.
- **markSectionUnlock(player, section)** exported; **mb_dayTracker** calls it for section `"timeline"` when **recordDailyEvent** adds a new event.
- **markSectionViewed(player, sectionId)** (internal): called when opening Infection, Symptoms, Mobs, Items, Biomes, Late Lore, Timeline; sets `sectionLastViewed[sectionId] = Date.now()`.
- **Main menu buttons**: If a section has unseen content (`sectionLastUnlock` set and either never viewed or `sectionLastUnlock > sectionLastViewed`), button shows **§l§o** (bold+italic) and " §8(new)" or " §8(updated)" (new = never viewed, updated = viewed before but new content since). Cleared when that section is opened.
- **First open**: First time opening the Powdery Journal shows body line "§7Things are logged as you experience them!" and sets `hasOpenedBefore = true`.

## Addon-wide message color coding (plan updated)

Plan file: `.cursor/plans/addon-wide_message_color_coding_3d442138.plan.md`.

### Intro unchanged

- **Intro sequence** is **not** changed color-wise. All intro/welcome messages stay exactly as they are (current hardcoded colors). Do not replace any intro text with the new chat color constants. Sanity-check allows hardcoded § codes in intro messages.

### What each color means (quick reference)

| Constant | Code | In-game color | Meaning |
| -------- | ---- | ------------- | ------- |
| `CHAT_ACHIEVEMENT` | §6 | Gold | Achievements (first kill, first cure, KO, etc.). |
| `CHAT_DANGER` | §c | Red | Danger / infection / severe warnings. |
| `CHAT_DANGER_STRONG` | §4 | Dark red | Highest severity (e.g. "SOMETHING IS WRONG"). |
| `CHAT_SUCCESS` | §a | Green | Success: cured, immune, saved, "Settings saved!", unlock confirmed. |
| `CHAT_WARNING` | §e | Yellow | Caution: ground feels wrong, immunity weakening, minor infection. |
| `CHAT_INFO` | §7 | Gray | Neutral info: hits left, journal hints, general text. |
| `CHAT_DEV` | §8 | Dark gray | MBI/debug only; low emphasis. |
| `CHAT_HIGHLIGHT` | §f | White | Highlight for names, numbers, or emphasis inside a line. |
| `CHAT_SPECIAL` | §b | Aqua / cyan | Special/secondary emphasis (e.g. who shared with you, temporary immunity note). |

Implementation: new `BP/scripts/mb_chatColors.js`; then replace hardcoded colors in `main.js`, `mb_codex.js`, and `mb_dayTracker.js` (excluding intro).
