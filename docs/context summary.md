## Intro: per-player so each new player gets full intro

Previously the intro was tracked with a **world** property (`mb_world_intro_seen`), so once any player had seen the intro in that world, no other player ever got it. Requirement: **each player who has not joined a world before should get the full intro.**

### Changes made

1. **main.js**
   - Added **PLAYER_INTRO_SEEN_PROPERTY** (`mb_intro_seen`) — per-player dynamic property meaning "this player has seen the intro."
   - **showWorldIntroSequence**: checks/sets **getPlayerProperty(player, PLAYER_INTRO_SEEN_PROPERTY)** instead of world property, so only that player is marked as having seen the intro.
   - **Player join handler**: uses **getPlayerProperty(player, PLAYER_INTRO_SEEN_PROPERTY)** to decide whether to show intro for this player.
   - **Discovery suppression**, **spawn fallback**, **minor infection init**, **giveBasicJournalIfNeeded**: all now use the **player’s** intro-seen flag (getPlayerProperty(player, PLAYER_INTRO_SEEN_PROPERTY)) so behavior is per-player.
   - Left WORLD_INTRO_SEEN_PROPERTY in place as legacy; intro logic no longer uses it.

2. **mb_dayTracker.js**
   - Import **getPlayerProperty** from `mb_dynamicPropertyHandler.js`.
   - "First-time player" and welcome-message timing now use **getPlayerProperty(player, "mb_intro_seen")** so each player is classified by whether **they** have seen the intro.

Result: Every player who joins and has not seen the intro before gets the full intro sequence; returning players skip it. State is stored per player (dynamic property), not per world.

## Mining AI: cleanup lastBlockBreakTick to prevent unbounded memory growth (mb_miningAI.js)

The per-entity Map **lastBlockBreakTick** (lines 267–269) was never cleared; only **lastMiningTick** was pruned in the existing cleanup routine. Inactive entity IDs could accumulate in **lastBlockBreakTick** and cause memory growth.

### Fix

- In the same cleanup block that prunes **lastMiningTick** (around line 10676), added a matching loop for **lastBlockBreakTick**: iterate over `lastBlockBreakTick.entries()`, and for each `entityId` where `!activeWorkerIds.has(entityId)`, call `lastBlockBreakTick.delete(entityId)`.
- **buildQueues** is already cleaned in this routine via the existing loop that calls `releasePlan(entityId)` for inactive entities (lines 10655–10660), so no change was needed there.

Result: **lastBlockBreakTick** and **lastMiningTick** stay in sync; both maps are pruned for the same inactive entity IDs, preventing unbounded growth.

## Mining AI: run every tick for movement, throttle only block breaking (mb_miningAI.js)

Bears were going slow and not climbing blocks/stairs because **processContext** was only called every **miningInterval** ticks (2–12 ticks by day) for leaders and followers. That throttled the whole AI (pathfinding, steering, climbing) instead of only block-breaking speed.

### Fix

1. **Main loop**  
   Leaders and followers now run **processContext every tick**. The `if (ticksSinceLastMining >= miningInterval)` guard and `lastMiningTick.set` for leaders/followers were removed so movement and climbing run every tick.

2. **Block-breaking throttle inside processContext**  
   - New map: **lastBlockBreakTick** — last tick this entity broke a block.  
   - At start of processContext: `miningInterval = getMiningInterval()`, `allowMiningThisTick = (tick - lastBlockBreakTick) >= miningInterval`, `effectiveBudget = allowMiningThisTick ? digBudget : 0`, and **digContext.max = effectiveBudget**.  
   - At end of processContext: if `digContext.cleared > 0` then `lastBlockBreakTick.set(entity.id, tick)`.

Result: Bears get steering/impulse and stair logic every tick (responsive movement and climbing). Block breaking still respects mining speed (every 2–12 ticks by day). Idle bears unchanged (still process at miningInterval * 2).

## Mining debug logging reverted (mb_miningAI.js)

Rate-limited mining debug (DEBUG_LOG_INTERVAL / shouldLogMiningDebug) was reverted because mining bears stopped jumping onto 1-block steps and climbing upward stairs. All rate-limiting was removed and the original pattern restored (see above for the actual movement fix).

## Snow block lists extracted to shared module

`SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS` and `SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS` were duplicated in `BP/scripts/mb_torpedoAI.js` (lines 28–46) and `BP/scripts/main.js`. They were moved into a shared module and both files now import them.

### Changes made

1. **New `BP/scripts/mb_blockLists.js`**  
   - Exports `SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS` and `SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS` (same names).  
   - Contains the canonical Sets used for death/torpedo snow placement (grass, flowers, foliage; 2-block-tall plants).  
   - `SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS` includes `minecraft:grass_block` (from torpedo list).

2. **`BP/scripts/mb_torpedoAI.js`**  
   - Removed inline `SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS` and `SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS` definitions.  
   - Added: `import { SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS, SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS } from "./mb_blockLists.js";`  
   - All existing usages (e.g. `.has(blockType)`) unchanged; symbols now come from the import.

3. **`BP/scripts/main.js`**  
   - Removed inline `SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS` and `SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS` definitions.  
   - Added: `import { SNOW_REPLACEABLE_BLOCKS, SNOW_TWO_BLOCK_PLANTS } from "./mb_blockLists.js";`  
   - All references in death/snow placement logic unchanged; symbols now come from the import.

Result: Single source of truth for snow-replaceable and two-block-plant lists; no code changes needed at call sites beyond the new imports.

## "Check your journal" — one-time only (fixed)

The "Check your journal" message was repeating (once per "batch" until the player opened the journal). It should behave like other discovery messages: **show once ever when the player discovers something new**, and **never repeat** for that same discovery.

### Changes made

1. **Persistent flag in codex** (`mb_codex.js`)  
   - Added `checkJournalMessageShown: false` to `codex.items` in `getDefaultCodex()` so the one-time state is saved with the player's codex.

2. **`main.js`**  
   - Removed the in-memory `checkJournalPendingByPlayer` Map and all references (including the delete when opening the journal).  
   - **`sendDiscoveryMessage`**: When the player has the journal (`snowBookCrafted`), the message and sound are shown only if `!codex.items.checkJournalMessageShown`. When shown, set `codex.items.checkJournalMessageShown = true`, call `markCodex` and `saveCodex`.  
   - **Golden apple infection reduction**: Same logic — show "Check your journal" only if the flag is false; when shown, set the flag and rely on the existing `saveCodex` to persist.

Result: "Check your journal" is sent **once per player** (first discovery with journal); it never repeats, consistent with other discovery messages.
