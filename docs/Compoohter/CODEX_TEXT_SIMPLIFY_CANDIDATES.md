# Codex Text That Could Be Simplified

All locations are in **`BP/scripts/mb_codex.js`**. “Big” or formal words are replaced with shorter, plainer options where it helps. Some flavor is kept; you can skip any line.

## BuildSummary / Infection tab (main codex body)

If you want to simplify the main summary text (infection status, timers, etc.), that lives in **`buildSummary()`** and the **Infection** section (lines ~710–880 and ~991–1270). Same idea: replace "significant", "comprehensive", "utilize", "approximately", "consumption", "progression", "neutralize", etc. with "big", "full", "use", "about", "eating", "growth", "clear", etc. where it reads easier.

**Summary:** The tables above point to every major codex string that uses heavier or formal wording. You can apply these in small batches (e.g. Symptoms first, then Cure, then Mobs) and keep any lines you prefer as-is.
