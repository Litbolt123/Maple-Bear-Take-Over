# Maple Bear Takeover - 100 Feature Ideas

Based on existing lore: white powder/dust infection (mysterious white powdery substance), Maple Bears (Tiny, Infected, Buff, Flying, Mining, Torpedo), day progression system, Powdery Journal (gameplay mechanic), infected biome, victory at Day 25 (potential 100-day endgame), and evolving bear variants.

**Key Context:**
- The powder is a "mysterious white powdery substance" (drug metaphor - "Don't do drugs kids...")
- Bears evolve over time (explains variants)
- Journal is gameplay-only, no lore needed
- Current victory at Day 25, potential 100-day endgame goal
- **Player Transformation**: When infected players die (from infection timer OR killed by any Maple Bear), they spawn an infected bear with nametag `§4! ${player.name}'s Infected Form`. Multiple deaths = multiple infected forms. Currently spawn as normal infected bears (not buffed) - **needs enhancement to be smarter/buffed**.
- **Snow Mechanics**: Tier-based system (1-6 tiers) with progressive effects. First consumption starts infection. While infected: Tier 1-2 slows/neutral, Tier 3+ accelerates. Effects get darker at higher tiers (paranoia, withdrawals, cravings).
- **Buff Bears**: Mini-bosses that drop snow (3-18). Need better rewards and AI fixes (they get stuck easily).

## 📝 Notes

- All ideas should fit the existing lore about the mysterious white powdery substance, evolving bears, infection, and the mysterious nature of the outbreak
- Consider the day progression system (Days 2, 4, 8, 13, 20, 25+) with potential 100-day endgame
- Bears evolve over time - this explains variants and should be incorporated into new bear ideas
- The powder is a "mysterious white powdery substance" - keep it mysterious, don't explicitly name what it is
- Journal is gameplay-only (codex system) - no lore needed for it
- Maintain the atmospheric tone: mysterious, unsettling, with hints of something greater controlling events
- The "counting" and "memory" themes from late lore should be incorporated where possible
- Ideas should enhance the survival horror/apocalypse feel
- The addiction metaphor (snow tiers, progressive effects) should be maintained
