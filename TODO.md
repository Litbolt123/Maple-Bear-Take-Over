- ✅ API 2.0.0 compatibility fixes
- ✅ Safety checks for unavailable event handlers
- ✅ Robust effects detection with multiple fallback methods
- ✅ Fixed global object and command result handling

### Performance & Code Quality
- ✅ Performance optimizations (biome check cooldowns, module-scoped functions)
- ✅ Eliminated debug log spam with conditional DEBUG_SNOW_MECHANICS flag
- ✅ Optimized block placement handlers (snow layer conversion only)
- ✅ Centralized milestone messaging system
- ✅ Removed redundant code and improved maintainability
- ✅ Fixed unreachable code paths and redundant function calls

### User Interface & Experience
- ✅ Infection Tracker Book (`mb:snow_book`) with comprehensive on-demand UI
- ✅ Progressive codex system with discovery-based unlocks
- ✅ Biome discovery system with visual feedback
- ✅ Daily event logging with reflection-based storytelling
- ✅ Complete display transforms for snow layer model
- ✅ Alternative debug system using item interactions
- ✅ Day-based welcome messages and world state awareness

### Progressive Knowledge System
- ✅ Multi-level knowledge progression (Basic Awareness → Understanding → Expert)
- ✅ Knowledge-based information gating (players must experience to learn)
- ✅ Dynamic welcome messages based on player knowledge level
- ✅ Progressive mob statistics (unlocked by kill count and knowledge level)
- ✅ Conditional item descriptions based on infection status and discovery
- ✅ Biome infection tracking with visit counts and infection level analysis
- ✅ Knowledge gates where advanced info requires other discoveries first
- ✅ Experience-driven information revelation (no spoilers for new players)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Resolved
- ✅ Chat event handler not available in API 2.0.0 (replaced with item-based debug system)
- ✅ Animation controller errors (non-critical, handled gracefully)
- ✅ Command syntax differences in API 2.0.0 (fixed)
- ✅ Global object not available in API 2.0.0 (fixed)
- ✅ Debug log spam (resolved with conditional DEBUG_SNOW_MECHANICS flag)
- ✅ Performance issues with biome checks (optimized with cooldown system)
- ✅ Redundant code and unreachable paths (cleaned up)

## 📌 Technical Notes

### Custom Biomes
- Custom biomes require enabling the "Custom Biomes" experiment on the world
- Partial biome replacement is experimental and may change
- Mixing custom biome generation with existing saved chunks can create seams; test on a fresh world or backup first

### Performance Optimizations
- Biome checks now use 10-second cooldown per player to reduce server load
- Block placement handlers optimized to only process snow-related blocks
- Module-scoped functions prevent recreation on every interval
- Debug logging conditionally enabled to prevent console spam

### API Compatibility
- Using API version 2.0.0 with comprehensive safety checks
- Robust effects detection with 3 fallback methods:
  1. `getEffect("minecraft:weakness")` - Direct method
  2. `getEffects()` - List all effects and find weakness  
  3. Command method - Final fallback (with proper null checking)

### Debug System
- Console functions: `testWeaknessDetection('playerName')`, `addWeaknessToPlayer('playerName')`, `checkInfectionStatus('playerName')`
- Item interactions: Book (test effects), Paper (add weakness), Map (check infection)
- Debug flag: Set `DEBUG_SNOW_MECHANICS = true` in main.js to enable verbose logging

## 🎯 Current Focus Areas
1. **Stability**: All core systems are stable and performant
2. **User Experience**: Comprehensive codex system provides rich discovery mechanics
3. **Performance**: Optimized for server environments with multiple players
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code with centralized systems
