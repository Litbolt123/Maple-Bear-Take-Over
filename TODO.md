# Maple Bear Takeover - TODO List

## 🔧 Current Status
- ✅ Basic Maple Bear entities (tiny, infected, buff)
- ✅ Item pickup behavior for all bear types
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Bear infection system (20-day timer)

- ✅ Cure system for bear infection (weakness + notch apple)
- ✅ Day tracking system
- ✅ Item corruption on infected bear death
- ✅ API 2.0.0 compatibility fixes
- ✅ Safety checks for unavailable event handlers
- ✅ Alternative debug system using item interactions
- ✅ Robust effects detection with multiple fallback methods
- ✅ Fixed global object and command result handling

## 🐛 Known Issues
- Chat event handler not available in API 2.0.0 (replaced with item-based debug system)
- Animation controller errors (non-critical)
- Command syntax differences in API 2.0.0 (fixed)
- Global object not available in API 2.0.0 (fixed)

## 📝 Notes
- Using API version 2.0.0 with safety checks
- Debug system available via:
  - Console functions: `testWeaknessDetection('playerName')`, `addWeaknessToPlayer('playerName')`, `checkInfectionStatus('playerName')`
  - Item interactions: Book (test effects), Paper (add weakness), Map (check infection)
- Core functionality working properly
- Cure system uses robust effects detection with 3 fallback methods:
  1. `getEffect("minecraft:weakness")` - Direct method
  2. `getEffects()` - List all effects and find weakness
  3. Command method - Final fallback (with proper null checking)
