WARNING

The Script API is currently in active development, and breaking changes are frequent. This page assumes the format of Minecraft 1.21.20

WARNING

This module can only be used on Bedrock Dedicated Servers.

In Script API, you can send and receive HTTP-based requests to interact with the internet. For more detailed information please visit theMicrosoft docs.

Setup ​
Dependencies

Like other modules, you will need to add the dependency into your manifest.json

{
    "dependencies": [
        {
            "module_name": "@minecraft/server-net",
            "version": "1.0.0-beta"
        }
    ]
}
Enable module in Bedrock Dedicated Server ​
Download the Bedrock Dedicated Server package from the Minecraft website

Extract the zip file on a folder.

This is the tree for a default Bedrock Dedicated Server:

📂BedrockServer
📝behavior_packs
📂config
📂default
📝permissions.json
📝definitions
📝development_behavior_packs
📝development_resource_packs
📝development_skin_packs
📝resource_packs
📝structures
📂worlds
📂BedrockLevel
📝behavior_packs
📝db
📝resource_packs
📝world_templates
In the permissions.json file located in config/<pack_id>/permissions.json or config/default/permissions.json, enable @minecraft/server-net module by adding "@minecraft/server-net" in the allowed_modules key. This module is not enabled by default in the server.
Modifying the files in the default config folder allows every add-on with the server-net module to have access to the @minecraft/server-net module.
It is recommended to assign individual permissions for each script behavior pack.
BedrockServer/config/default/permissions.json

{
    "allowed_modules": [
        "@minecraft/server-gametest",
        "@minecraft/server",
        "@minecraft/server-ui",
        "@minecraft/server-admin",
        "@minecraft/server-editor",
        "@minecraft/server-net"
    ]
}
Http Request Methods ​
Script API supports the following HTTP request methods:

DELETE
GET
HEAD
POST
PUT
Simple HTTP Request ​
http.get(url) - Performs a simple HTTP get request in behavior packs.

url: string
Returns: Promise<HttpResponse>
Since most requests are GET requests without bodies, @minecraft/server-net provides this convenience method. The only difference between this method and http.request() is that it sets the method to GET automatically.

Example:

import { http } from "@minecraft/server-net";

http.get("http://example.com/").then((response) => {
    // Body content of the HTTP response.
    // Type: string
    const body = response.body;
});
Advanced HTTP Request ​
http.request ​
Makes a request to a web server.

config: HttpRequest
Returns: Promise<HttpResponse>
Config must be a new HttpRequest instance in order to structuring a request.

Examples ​
Here are the following ways to send a request to a web server, includes each available http request methods.

Create a HttpRequest object

import { HttpRequest } from "@minecraft/server-net";

const request = new HttpRequest("http://localhost:8000/"); // You must put a url as the parameter
Set HTTP method

More information on HTTP request methods: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods

GET

import { HttpRequestMethod } from "@minecraft/server-net";
request.method = HttpRequestMethod.Get;
HEAD

import { HttpRequestMethod } from "@minecraft/server-net";
request.method = HttpRequestMethod.Head;
POST

import { HttpRequestMethod } from "@minecraft/server-net";
request.method = HttpRequestMethod.Post;
PUT

import { HttpRequestMethod } from "@minecraft/server-net";
request.method = HttpRequestMethod.Put;
DELETE

import { HttpRequestMethod } from "@minecraft/server-net";
request.method = HttpRequestMethod.Delete;
Set HTTP headers

A HTTP header can be used in an HTTP request to provide information about the request context, so that the server can tailor the response.

import { HttpHeader } from "@minecraft/server-net";
request.headers = [
    new HttpHeader("Content-Type", "application/json"),
    new HttpHeader("auth", "my-auth-token"),
];
HttpHeader value parameter also accept SecretString object in '@minecraft/server-admin' module.

import { HttpHeader } from "@minecraft/server-net";
import { secrets } from "@minecraft/server-admin";

const secret = secrets.get("TOKEN");
request.headers = [new HttpHeader("Authorization", secret)];
Set request body

Content of the body of the HTTP request, this information will be sent to a web server.

request.body = "Message";
Set response timeout

Set the amount of time, in seconds, before the request times out and is abandoned.

This property is not frequently used in HTTP requests.

request.timeout = 10; // 10 seconds
Send request

Send the request to a web server, returns a promise HttpResponse.

http.request(request).then((response) => {
    // Body content of the HTTP response.
    // Type: string
    response.body;
});
Example:

A simple script to post sent chat messages messages to a discord webhook.

import { world } from "@minecraft/server";
import { http, HttpRequest, HttpRequestMethod, HttpHeader } from "@minecraft/server-net";

// Note that this event requires server module version 1.14.0-beta.
world.afterEvents.chatSend.subscribe((data) => {
    // The message a player sent.
    const chatMsg = data.message;

    // Create a new request to a discord webhook URL.
    const request = new HttpRequest("https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-here");

    // Set the method to a post type (sending only)
    request.method = HttpRequestMethod.Post;

    // Set the body of the request to the format discord requires.
    // More on this topic can be found here: https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook
    request.body = JSON.stringify({
        content: chatMsg,
    });

    // Set the headers of the request.
    request.headers = [new HttpHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")];

    // Perform the request.
    http.request(request).then((response) => {
        // Body of the HTTP request response.
        response.body;
    });
});
